DS and ML project on Agriculture crop production in India 
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural crop production in India using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to gain insights into various factors influencing crop production and develop predictive models for crop yield.

Project Overview
In this project, we explore a dataset containing historical data on crop production in different regions of India. We aim to answer questions such as:

What are the major crops grown in India?
How does crop production vary across different states?
Can we develop a model to predict crop yield based on these factors?
